GitHub milestones and issues can be used to track and coordinate multiple teams working on parallel projects. You can use custom `projmgr` plans to set up a group of repos with a standard set of milestones and issues. This is useful whenever you're overseeing a large group of people who should be following some similar process -- for example, at a hackathon, unconf, group working session, or training.

## Configuring Issues and Milestones

Imagine you are planning a hackathon or working session with 5 teams, each with their own GitHub repo within your organization named "team{i}" (for i from 1 to 5).

Suppose there is a specific set of steps you wish each team to progress through. These can be specified as a custom plan. For example, in a separate YAML file, suppose you save the following plan in a file "plan.yml".

```{r eval = FALSE}
- title: Pre-Work
  description: Tasks to be completed before the hackathon
  due_on: 2019-12-31
  issue:
    - title: Introductions
      body: Each team member should post a brief introduction of themselves here
    - title: Project brainstorming
      body: >
        Each team member should post at least 1 project idea here and attempt to
        provide at least 1 constructive comment on another project idea shared.

    - title: Assign roles

        Roles can and should be fluid, but deciding upfront what team member take
        certain leading roles will save time throughout the day.

plan <- read_plan(plan_yml)
```

We can check that our plan was read correctly by printing it back out.

```{r}
print(plan)
```

Next, create repository references for each repo, using `purrr::map()` for iteration.

```{r eval = FALSE}
repo_names <- paste0("team", 1:5)
repo_refs <- purrr::map(repo_names, ~create_repo_ref("emilyriederer", .))
```

Finally, we can again use `purrr::walk()` to post the project plan to each GitHub repository. (Note that `purrr::map()` would also work here, but `purrr::walk()` executes silently which is convenient when we don't care about the return values.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
purrr::walk(repo_refs, ~post_plan(., plan))
```

Each repo is now populated with a set of milestones and related issues for the respective team to work through.

## Communication

Posting project plans in this way has numerous benefits. Participants in your event may be interested to know ahead what they will be doing. Using the `report_plan()` function, you can convert all of the same information on GitHub into an aesthetic and readable list that could be shared in a website or an email

```{r}
report_plan(plan)
```


## Tracking

You can also use this to monitor participant progress throughout the event, potentially noticing groups that are falling behind and might need assistance. We can apply our `get_milestones()` and `parse_milestones()` functions by mapping over the repository references.

```{r eval = FALSE}
milestone_lists <- purrr::map(repo_refs, get_milestones)
milestones <- purrr::map_dfr(milestone_lists, parse_milestones, .id = 'team')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
milestones <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "event-milestones.rds", package = "projmgr", mustWork = TRUE))
milestones$n_closed_issues <- c(2,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
milestones$n_open_issues <- milestones$n_open_issues - milestones$n_closed_issues
milestones$closed_at <- ifelse(milestones$n_open_issues == 0, milestones$due_on, milestones$closed_at)
```

This gives us data on all teams:

```{r}
milestones
```

Which we can wrangle for quick summary views:

```{r}
milestones %>%
  dplyr::mutate(percent_complete = n_closed_issues * 100 / (n_closed_issues + n_open_issues)) %>%
  dplyr::select(team, title, percent_complete, number) %>%
  tidyr::spread(team, percent_complete) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(number) %>%
  dplyr::select(-number)
```

In some cases a [GitHub Project Board](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) might be a better choice, but R provides easy integration with tweets, emails, Shiny apps, or other tools you may be using to communicate throughout your event.
