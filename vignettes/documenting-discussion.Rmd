library(ghtrackr)
```

If the comments of a  GitHub issue contain an important discussions regarding your analysis, you may wish to save an immutable copy of this conversation for documentation. For example, consider this important discussion:

![GitHub issue with comments](report_discussion.PNG)

You can do this in two steps. First, `get` the issue metadata and comments from GitHub with `get_issues()` and `get_issue_comments()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
issues <- get_issues(experigit, number = 163) %>% parse_issues()
comments <- get_issue_comments(experigit, number = 163) %>% parse_issue_comments()
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
issues <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "disc-issues.rds", package = "ghtrackr", mustWork = TRUE))
comments <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "disc-comments.rds", package = "ghtrackr", mustWork = TRUE))
```

As with all other `get-parse` codeflows, this produces dataframe output.

```{r}
head(issues)
head(comments)
```

Next, simply pass these into the `report_discussion()` function to generate a formatted RMarkdown report.

```{r}
report_discussion(comments, issues)
```

Note that the `issues` dataframe is optional. You can pass only the comments in for documentation, but you do risk missing out on important context from the issue description and metadata.

```{r}
report_discussion(comments)
```
