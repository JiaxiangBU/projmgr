In many cases, it can be useful to automate bulk posting of issues or milestones to GitHub. `tidytracker` helps facilitate this with the notion of plans and to-do lists.

**Plans** are a collection of milestones and issues assigned to them. In general, these issues are going to be created *proactively* as foreseen key steps in a project (versus the more common *reactive* usage of GitHub issues to report bugs and request enhancements.) Plans can serve as a roadmap or framework for tackling a large chunk of work.

**To-do lists** are simply collections of issues. These might just be many bugs, feature enhancements, or ideas you jotted down while working offline or while not wanting to get on GitHub to log them. Alternatively, they also could be created proactively as with plans.

To reduce the manual effort of bulk creation of plans and to-do lists, `tidytracker` offers functionality to read, interpret, and post milestones and issues encoded in [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a light-weight markup language.

## Creating a Plan with YAML

YAML can be used to specify milestones and issues with all the same fields as are accepted into `post_milestone()` and `post_issue()`. Consider the following YAML file as an example:

```{r comment='', echo = FALSE}
plan_path <- system.file("extdata", "plan.yml", package = "tidytracker", mustWork = TRUE)
cat(readLines(plan_path), sep = '\n')
```

The `read_my_plan_todo_yaml()` function reads in either plan or to-do YAML files. We will continue to work with the example plan embedded in the package.

```{r}
plan_path <- system.file("extdata", "plan.yml", package = "tidytracker", mustWork = TRUE)
my_plan <- read_plan(plan_path)
```

This function converts YAML to an R list. You can sanity check the structure of this output with base R `str()` function which shows the structure of a list:

```{r}
str(my_plan)
```

Finally, this collection of milestones and associated issues can be posted to GitHub with the `post_plan()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
experigit <- create_repo_ref("emilyriederer", "experigit")
post_plan(experigit, my_plan)
```

The result of this command would be the creation of two milestones created in the `experigit` repo. The first has three issues and the second has two issues.

Note that you can also pass in YAML directly as a character string:

```{r}
plan_yaml_vbl <- "
milestone1:
  title: First draft
  body: Complete the first draft of this paper for review

milestone2:
  title: Make revisions
  body: Repsond to feedback from reviewers
"

plan_from_vbl <- read_plan(plan_yaml_vbl)
str(plan_from_vbl)
```

Should you ever forget exactly what this YAML should look like, the `template_yaml()` function is here to help. It prints a template example to your console:

```{r}
template_yaml("plan")
```


## Create a To-Do List with YAML

The workflow for posting to-do lists is very similar to that of plans. Consider the following YAML file as an example:

```{r comment='', echo = FALSE}
todo_path <- system.file("extdata", "todo.yml", package = "tidytracker", mustWork = TRUE)
cat(readLines(todo_path), sep = '\n')
```

Similarly, the `read_todo()` function reads in a to-do YAML file and converts it to an R list:

```{r}
todo_path <- system.file("extdata", "todo.yml", package = "tidytracker", mustWork = TRUE)
my_todo <- read_todo(todo_path)
str(my_todo)
```

This collection of issues can be posted to a GitHub with the `post_todo()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
experigit <- create_repo_ref("emilyriederer", "experigit")
post_todo(experigit, my_todo)
```

Just like with plans, you can also pass a character string instead of a file and use `template_yaml()` to remind yourself of the required format: 

```{r}
template_yaml("todo")
```

## Create a Plan or To-Do List with R

Of course, `tidytracker`'s YAML-parsing functionalities are only provided as a convenience. Users are also welcome to create their own plans and to-do lists simply with base R's `list()` function. For example, the following code creates an analog to the second milestone in the YAML above.

```{r}
milestone <-
list(
  title = "Exporatory data analysis",
  description = "Create basic statistics and views",
  issue = list(
    list(title = "Summary statistics",
         body = "Calculate summary statistics"),
    list(title = "Visualizations",
         body = "Create univariate and bivariate plots")
    )
)

str(milestone)
```
