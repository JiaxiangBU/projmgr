# projmgr <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

`projmgr` aims to better integrate project management into your workflow and free up time for more exciting tasks like R coding and data analysis. Since many R users and programmers use GitHub as a home for their analysis, the goal of `projmgr` is to streamline project management with these same tools.

Key functionalities include:

- exchanging data with the GitHub API using user-friendly syntax
- generating issues and milestones from plain text (YAML) or R objects
- communicating (with reports or charts) project plans and progress to non-technical (non-GitHub using) collaborators

Just like communicating analytical results, good process communication is the key to success in most applied analysis settings. However, ad hoc processes or alternative tools can knock an analyst out of their R-based workflow and distract them from their core goals.
