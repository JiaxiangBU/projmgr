The goal of `ghtrackr` is to help reduce time spent on tedious project management tasks to free up time for more exciting things like R coding and data analysis. `ghtrackr` does this by providing a convenient interface between your R-based workflow and GitHub, with a particular focus on GitHub's project management capabilities.
