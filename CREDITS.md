# Credits

Throughout development of this package, I learned a lot both through great blog posts / resources and also by digging into the source code of some great pre-existing API wrapper packages. This section gives kudos to those resources and their creators.

## Using APIs in R

Before you write an API wrapper, you have to learn the basics of APIs. Here are a few great talks on using the `httr` R package:

- Amanda Gardrow's rstudio::conf 2017 talk, [Using Web APIs in R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/using-web-apis-from-r/) from rstudio::conf 2017
- Lucy D'Agostino McGowan's JSM 2018 talk, [Harnessing the Power of the Web via R Clients for Web APIs](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/talk/asa_joint_statistical_meeting_2018/) 

## Writing API Packages in R

- Hadley Wickham's `httr` vigneete [Best practices for API packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)
- Colin Fay's blog [How to Build an API Wrapper Package in 10 Minutes](https://colinfay.me/build-api-wrapper-package-r/)

## Example API Packages

I prowled through countless GitHub repos on this journey, but here are a few API packages that I kept digging into particularly to see if what I was doing made sense.

- Kyle Walker's [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) package
- Charlie Thompson's [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr) package
- Amanda Dobbyn's [postal](https://github.com/aedobbyn/postal) package
- Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's [ghclass](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/ghclass) package
- RStudio's [gh](https://github.com/r-lib/gh) package

## R Package Development

Finally, while I was not new to package development, this process was of course facilitated by the phenomanl resources that are:

- Hadley Wickham's [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book
- Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) book
- Maelle Salmon's [How to Develop a Good R Package (for Open Science)](https://masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/)
- The [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package
- The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package
